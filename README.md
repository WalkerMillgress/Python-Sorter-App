# Python Sorter App
 A very simple app with Python and Tkinter that selects random files and moves them to a "sorted" folder.

I might update in the future to try out some Qt GUIs, but for now, it just remains a simple demo. If anyone wants to use it, feel free!

It's a simple Python file, nothing too complex, although you may need to install some additional modules. Namely, tkinter and shutil, if memory serves me well. Thanks for giving it a try!
